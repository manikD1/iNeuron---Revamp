## **🤔 What did I learn making this project ? 🤔**

- This project is my submission to the FindCoder Hackathon for Javascript live batch - the 1st hackathon for live class batch. This project is solely made by using pure HTML and CSS. It is based on my current skill set and as time progresses my expertise and finese on such pages would improve. I have extensively used the animation property, multiple videos shown in background, box-shadow, drop-shadow effects, etc.
